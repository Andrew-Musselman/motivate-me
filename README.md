# Motivate Me
Motivational poster creator. This site will allow you to generate a random poster or make your own. When you create your own poster, it saves the submitted data so that future posters can use it. Additionally, you have the option to save posters, delete posters from a collection, and replace individual elements (image, title, quote) on your main poster.

#### Tech

This site was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are three views for this page:
- Main page
- Make Your Own Poster page
- Saved Posters page

#### Contributors
This site was built by [Kim Ward](https://github.com/kmewrd) and [Andrew Musselman](https://github.com/Andrew-Musselman) as a pair project at Turing School of Software & Design.

## Step-by-Step Guide
#### Part 1: Main Page
The site can be opened at [this link](https://andrew-musselman.github.io/motivate-me/). On load, you will see the main page and a poster with a randomly selected image, title, and quote.

Every time the Show Another Random Poster button is clicked, a new random poster will be displayed.

#### Part 2: Switching Page View
When you click the Show Saved Posters button, it will take you to the saved posters area. The Back to Main button takes you back to the main page.

Clicking on the Make Your Own Poster button will take you to a form that contains fields to enter an image URL, title, and quote for your custom poster. If you decide not to create your own poster, you can click on the Nevermind button and go back to the main page without filling out the form.

#### Part 3: Make a Custom Poster

On the poster form, fill in the three fields with your desired text and image URL. Show my poster will bring you back to the main page view with your custom poster displayed. It will also save your submitted data so that you can use it for future random posters.
